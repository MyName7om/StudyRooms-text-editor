# StudyRooms-text-editor
This is the text editor built in react 

# Before editing pull the repo!!
I think I'll implement merge requests or something like that so the code does not break.

## this is based off of 
- this yt vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRaelG7v0OU&t=183s
- there is also some repos on github that i will use for things like mutli cursors, mentions and other things that look good

## Notes 
- I have only used basic css stuff so that it can be implemented with no problems there
- I believe you will be able to copy and paste the styles.css straight over into the main styles
- I can't remember how you install all the dependancies if I am correct it is just npm install i??
